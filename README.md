**What is the Tokens plugin?**  

Tokens was initially developed for use in my private server, the idea was to give players a special currency "Tokens" that they can use to allocate to mcMMO Levels, faction power, or convert straight into money. I plan on adding support for many more plugins as the request come in, I will be keeping this plugin up-to-date.​

**What plugins are supported?**  

-   **[Factions UUID](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/)**
-   **[mcMMO Classic](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/official-mcmmo-classic.2445/)**
-   **[mcMMO Revived](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/official-mcmmo-original-author-returns.64348/)**
-   **[CombatLogX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/combatlogx.31689/)**
-   **[Any Vault Economy](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)**
